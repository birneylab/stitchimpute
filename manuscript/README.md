# Manuscript figures

This folder contains vector images of the figures used in the manuscript describing the stitchimpute pipeline, and a Jupyter notebook containing the code required to reproduce them.
Note that the paths in the Jupyter notebook will need to be updated according to your system.
The data files needed to reproduce the images can be produced by running the full pipeline.
